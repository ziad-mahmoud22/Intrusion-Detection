# Intrusion Detection System with Anomaly Detection Using Machine Learning  

## Overview  
This project focuses on building an anomaly detection system for network intrusion detection using the CICIDS2017 dataset. It leverages multiple machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and a Neural Network. The project is deployed as a Flask web application, enabling users to upload datasets, select models, and obtain predictions on network activity.  

## Features  
- **Dataset**: CICIDS2017, a comprehensive intrusion detection dataset.  
- **Models**: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, and a Neural Network.  
- **Web Application**: Built with Flask, allowing:  
  - CSV file uploads for network traffic analysis.  
  - Selection of machine learning models for predictions.  
  - Easy-to-read results mapped to original attack labels.  
- **Future Integration**: Planned extension into a full-fledged Intrusion Detection System (IDS), integrating tools like Wireshark for real-time monitoring.  

 

## Getting Started
